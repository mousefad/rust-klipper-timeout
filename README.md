# Klipper Timeout

This program watches the `klipper` clipboard for KDE/Plasma desktop setups and clears items from the clipboard history after some specified time. 


## TODO

* Upgrade zbus version to 5.x and port code as necessary.
* Review Cursor-generated code, clean-up and refactor as needed.
